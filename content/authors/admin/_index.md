I am a research and education technician at the [Mobile Perception Systems](https://www.tue.nl/en/research/research-groups/mobile-perception-systems-lab/) lab of the [Signal Processing Systems](https://www.tue.nl/en/research/research-groups/signal-processing-systems/) research group at [Department Electrical Engineering](https://www.tue.nl/en/our-university/departments/electrical-engineering/) of [TU/e](https://www.tue.nl/en/). My task is to support the development of the lab's artificial intelligence research software for autonomous systems (self-driving cars) and facilitate  education processes and activities. Also, I am involved in [5G-MOBIX](https://www.5g-mobix.com/) project.
